An API gateway is focused on 𝗿𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 requests to the appropriate microservice, while a load balancer is focused on 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 requests evenly across 
a group of backend servers.

An API gateway and a load balancer are both types of infrastructure that can be used in a computer network to manage incoming requests and enhance 
the performance of a system. However, they work in different ways and serve different purposes.

𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘄𝗮𝘆: 
  
  * An API gateway is a type of middleware that sits between a client and a collection of microservices. 

  * Its main purpose is to route requests from clients to the appropriate microservice and then to return the response from the microservice 
  back to the client. 

  * An API gateway can also perform other tasks such as authorization, rate limiting, and caching.

𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗯𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿: 

  * A load balancer, on the other hand, is a type of infrastructure that distributes incoming requests evenly across a group of backend 
    servers in order to improve the performance and availability of a system. 

  * Load balancers are typically used to handle requests that are 
    sent to a single, well-known IP address, and then route them to one of many possible backend servers based on factors such as 
    server performance and availability.

Another difference between the two is the type of requests that they typically handle. 

An API gateway is typically used to handle requests for APIs, which are web-based interfaces that allow applications to interact with each other 
over the internet. These requests typically have a specific URL that identifies the API that the client is trying to access, and the API gateway 
routes the request to the appropriate microservice based on this URL. 

A load balancer, on the other hand, is typically used to handle requests that are sent to a single, well-known IP address, and then routes them to 
one of many possible backend servers based on factors such as server performance and availability.
